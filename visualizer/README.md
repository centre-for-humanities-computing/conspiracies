# Visualizing graphs

This React App visualizes an interactive narrative graph as output by the pipeline.

It works as any React app in terms of building, running etc. If you just want to be able to start it locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node >=16 and npm installed. See https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm.
2. From the directory `conspiracies/visualizer`, run `npm install`.
3. Then run `npm start` which will open a development server on `localhost:3000`.
4. Load in the file `graph.json` from your output via the GUI.
